Excerpt: Who is Joseph Jude and what does he do?
---
finally{}, has been my personal weblog since 2003.

I'm a software craftsman by training. I enjoy coding. Here, in this blog, I share software related learnings. I also write a [blog](http://jjude.com), where I share business related learnings.

You can subscribe to my posts via [feed reader](/feed.xml) or via [email](http://eepurl.com/Lu3cr).

I've a wandering and restless spirit. I don't believe in growing roots in one place. I was born in [Tuticorin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoothukudi), studied in [Coimbatore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore), worked in [Chennai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai), [Brussels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels), [Bangalore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), and [Delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi). Now I have my startup at [Panchkula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchkula)
